# Abuse 2025

![hero](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/143352b6-dfe5-474f-926d-dd7f74548a85)

Celebrating its 30th anniversary, Abuse by Crack dot Com remains a timeless classic. Falsely imprisoned in an underground facility, Nick Vrenna becomes humanity's last hope when a genetic experiment called "Abuse" transforms guards and inmates alike into murderous mutants. As the only person immune to the infection, Nick must fight through hordes of grotesque creatures and security systems gone haywire to prevent the contaminated water supply from reaching the outside world. In this intense 90s action game, one man's quest for freedom becomes a desperate race to save humanity.

Experience revolutionary gameplay combining precision mouse aiming with fluid keyboard movement in this intense side-scrolling action platformer. Play through the whole campaign solo or in co-op, dive into community-created content like [fRaBs](https://github.com/IntinteDAO/fRaBs), create your own challenging levels with the built-in editor, or challenge your friends in action-packed LAN multiplayer deathmatches. With its fast-paced combat and atmospheric pixel art, Abuse delivers non-stop action that holds up to this day.

Available as libre software, with source code released under open licenses and game assets as non-commercial freeware. The original shareware content is public domain, making Abuse one of pioneers in accessible, community-supported gaming.

Abuse 2025 is a modern port of the original game, updated to run on modern systems and with new features like high-resolution graphics, gamepad support, and more. This project is a continuation of the [Xenoveritas SDL2 port](https://github.com/Xenoveritas/abuse) and the [Abuse 1996 project](https://github.com/antrad/Abuse_1996). It aims to be the go-to version for playing Abuse on modern systems.

## Getting Started

### Installation

For now, the game has to be built from source. See the [Development](#development) section for build instructions.

### Data Files

While this repository contains all data files needed to play the game, these assets come from different sources with varying licenses and historical records. My hope is that the educational and non-profit intentions of this repository will enable it to stay hosted and available. If you prefer to use only clearly-licensed content, please replace the included assets with the public domain subset of the original shareware content available from various archives online.

Save files and configuration are stored in the user folder, which can override default files in the game folder. This allows adding [custom levels](https://ettingrinder.youfailit.net/abuse-addons.html) or total modifications like [fRaBs](https://github.com/IntinteDAO/fRaBs) without affecting the original game files.

Default paths for user data:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\abuse`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/abuse/`
- Linux: `/usr/local/share/games/abuse`

### Basic Setup

1. Build and install the game following the platform-specific instructions
2. Configure display, audio, and controls settings in the config file (see [Configuration](#configuration))
3. Launch the game

For custom content:
- Place custom levels in the user data directory
- They will override any files with the same name in the base game directory

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `config.txt` in the user folder. It will be created if it doesn't exist at launch. Lines starting with ';' are comments. Use '1' to enable and '0' to disable options.

The game is designed to be played at an internal resolution of 320×200 (`virtual_width`×`virtual_height`). Using a higher resolution may reveal some hidden areas. However, when using the editor, a higher resolution is recommended for better visibility and usability.

### Controls

![controls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e92a2f53-a790-4b54-9db7-13e20e26b54b)

To better reflect modern game controls, the original arrow key controls have been replaced with WASD for movement. Mouse controls aim, left button shoots, right button activates special powers, and mouse scroll switches between weapons.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Falls**. Jumping off a ledge is the fastest way down. Falls never do any damage at all.

These keys cannot be remapped:

Game Controls:
- `1-7` - Direct weapon selection
- `Right Control` - Previous weapon
- `Insert` - Next weapon

| Compass               | Only available in network play. When acquired, the map view shows the locations of all the non-cloaked players.                                    |
| Special Abilities     | Once you run through an ability icon, hold down the right mouse button to use its special power.                                                   |

| Anti-Gravity Boots    | Gives you the ability to fly.                                                                                                                      |
